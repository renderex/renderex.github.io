# What you need

Congratulations! You've been hired by RendeRex so you may be wondering what's next? Well, first you'll need the following items at hand:

* Passport Copy 
* Signed Offer Letter
* ID Copy
* Degree stamped and signed by Ministry of Exterior (from the country of issue)

## Getting the degree stamped

If you don't have the degree stamped yet, or you are residing outside the country where you got your degree, you can simply go to the embassy and get it stamped there.
If you didn't have time, no worries, you can always get it stamped at the embassy upon arrival in the United Arab Emirates. However, to save time, whenever possible, we rceommend getting it stamped 
before arrival.
